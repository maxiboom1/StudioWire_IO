# Changelog

## v0.1.2

Small stabilization cleanup before v0.2 planning.

### Added

- PortGroup validation for planned-cable mode versus no-planned-cables mode.
- Reducer coverage for no-planned-cables device creation.
- `.gitattributes` line-ending policy for source, docs, JSON, CSS, and HTML files.
- README version changelog.

### Changed

- Bumped package version to `0.1.2`.
- Normalized PortGroup allocation semantics: when `createPlannedCables` is false, cable-number fields and `numberingRangeId` stay `null`, ports remain unlinked, and no ledger allocation occurs.
- Updated Add Device behavior to clear and disable cable-number fields when planned cable creation is disabled, then restore the next suggested number when re-enabled.
- Strengthened review bundle exclusions for generated artifacts such as TypeScript build info and StudioWire zip exports.
- Updated review workflow docs to prefer diff mode after approved version tags.

## v0.1.1

Stabilization release for v0.1 before v0.2 planning.

### Added

- Canonical planned cable creation module with source/cable/destination label rules.
- Validator coverage for settings names, cable prefix format, rack/device location consistency, port group range references, and planned cable ledger coverage.
- Tests for planned cable labels, stricter cable number parsing, and settings validation rules.
- Review bundle tooling and Vitest exclusion for generated review artifacts.
- Additional ledger and planned-cable consistency validation.

### Changed

- Refactored the monolithic app component into layout, settings, location, rack, device, and common component folders.
- Strengthened import behavior to reject malformed project objects and run validation immediately after import.
- Standardized port label patterns on `{DEVICE}` and `{000}` tokens.
- Updated sample project cable labels to use top/source, middle/cable number, bottom/destination.
- Allowed `Device.locationId` to be `null` for virtual/unassigned handling while keeping rack and non-rack location validation.
- Corrected the sample `V` ledger `nextSuggested` value to account for reserved gaps.
- Made `ADD_DEVICE` reject failed cable allocations without mutating project state.

### Removed

- Removed unused `@playwright/test` dev dependency.

## v0.1.0

Initial review-ready MVP.

### Added

- React, TypeScript, Vite, and plain CSS browser-only app shell.
- Project context and reducer with localStorage autosave.
- JSON import/export for schema version `0.1.0`.
- Project settings editor for project info, categories, connector types, and cable prefixes.
- Location and rack creation, editing, and guarded deletion.
- Device creation workflow with quick port groups, generated ports, planned cables, and cable ledger allocation.
- Cable number engine with reserved gap behavior and Vitest coverage.
- Validation engine shared by the UI and CLI tools.
- Sample project, JSON Schema, product docs, data model docs, validation docs, and roadmap.

### Changed

- Polished the main editor shell, modal styling, empty states, and validation panel presentation.
- Added confirmation before committing skipped cable-number gaps as reserved.
- Device destructive action now retires the device, planned cables, and related ledger ranges instead of freeing cable numbers.

### Not Included In v0.1

- Terminal blocks.
- Device-to-TB connections.
- Prewire export.
- Excel export.
- Bartender export.
- Visio export.
- Authentication.
- Backend or database storage.
